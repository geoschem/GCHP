HEMCO_Diagn.rc
==============

Like in GEOS-Chem Classic, the :file:`HEMCO_Diagn.rc` file is used to map between HEMCO containers and output file diagnostic names. Unlike in GEOS-Chem Classic, only HEMCO diagnostics also listed in :file:`HISTORY.rc` will be output. See the `GEOS-Chem ReadTheDocs page on this file <https://geos-chem.readthedocs.io/en/stable/gcclassic-user-guide/hemco-diagn.html>`_ for more information about :file:`HEMCO_Diagn.rc`.

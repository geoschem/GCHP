HEMCO_Diagn.rc
==============

Like in GEOS-Chem Classic, the :file:`HEMCO_Diagn.rc` file is used to map between HEMCO containers and output file diagnostic names. 
However, while all uncommented diagnostics listed in :file:`HEMCO_Diagn.rc` are output as HEMCO diagnostics in GEOS-Chem Classic, only the subset also listed in :file:`HISTORY.rc` are output in GCHP. 
See the HEMCO documentation for an overview of the file.

ExtData.rc
##########

:file:`ExtData.rc` contains input variable and file read information
for GCHP. Explanatory information about the file is located at the top
of the configuration file in all run directories. The file format is
the same as that used in the GEOS model, and GMAO/NASA documentation
for it can be found at the ExtData component page on the GEOS-5
wiki. Note that this file will be retired in GCHP v15.0 when MAPL
version 3 is integrated into GCHP. It will be replaced with a YAML
format file with a simplified and easier to understand interface.

The ins and outs of :file:`ExtData.rc` can be hard to grasp,
particular with regards to variable data updating, time interpolation,
and file read. Reach out on the GCHP GitHub Issues page if you need
help. See also the GCHP ReadTheDocs page on enabling ExtData prints
for debugging. Enabling ExtData debug prints is the best way to
determine what MAPL is doing for file I/O per import. The following
parameter is set at the top of the file:

.. option:: Ext_AllowExtrap

   Logical toggle to use data from nearest year available, including
   meteorology if files for the simulation year are not found. This is
   set to true for GCHP. Note that GEOS-Chem Classic accomplishes the
   same effect but with more flexibility in :ref:`cfg-hco-cfg`,
   and the entries of :file:`cfg-hco-cfg` which do this are  ignored
   in GCHP.

The rest of the file contains whitespace-delimited lines. Each line
describes one data variable imported to the model from an external
file.  Columns are as follows in order from left to right:

.. option:: Name

   Name of the field stored in the MAPL Imports container. This is
   independent of the name of the data field in the input file. For
   the case of entries that also appear in :file:`HEMCO_Config.rc` it
   is also the name of the HEMCO emissions container (left-most column
   in that file). For those fields it is used to match scaling and
   masking information in :file:`HEMCO_Config.rc` with file I/O
   information in :file:`ExtData.rc`. All file I/O information
   :ref:`cfg-hco-cfg`, including filename, units, dimensions,
   regridding, and read frequency are ignored by GCHP.

.. option:: Units

   Unit string of the import. This entry is informational only.

.. option:: Clim

   Whether the data is climatology. Enter :file:`Y` if the data is a
   12 month climatology, enter year if the data is daily climatology
   (i.e. :file:`2019`), :file:`D` if the file is monthly day-of-week
   scale factors (7 values for each of 12 months), or :file:`N` for
   all other cases. If you specify monthly climatology then the data
   must be stored in either 1 or 12 files.

.. option:: Conservative

   Method to regrid the input data to the simulation grid. Enter
   :file:`Y` to use mass conserving regridding, :literal:`F;{VALUE}`
   for fractional regridding, or :file:`N` to use
   non-conervative bilinear regridding.

.. option:: Refresh

   Time template for updating data. This tells MAPL when to look for
   new data values. It stores previous and next time data in what are
   called left and right brackets. There are several options for
   specifying refresh:

   * :file:`-` : Update variable data only once. Use this if the data
     is constant in time. |br|
     |br|

   * :file:`0` : Update variable data at every timestep using linear
     interpolation. For example, if the data is hourly then MAPL will
     linearly interpolate between the previous and next hour's data
     for every timestep. |br|
     |br|

   * :file:`0:003000` (or other HHMMSS specification for hours,
     minutes, seconds) : Use specified time offset (i.e. 30 minutes in
     this example) for setting previous and next time, and interpolate
     every timestep between the two. This is useful if, for example,
     you have time-averaged hourly data and you want the previous and
     next times to update half-way between the hour. This format is
     used for meteorology fields that are interpolated every timestep,
     specifically temperature and surface pressure. |br|
     |br|

   * :file:`F0:003000` (or other HHMMSS specification for hours,
     minutes, seconds) : Like the previous option except there is no
     time interpolation. This format is used for meteorology fields
     that are not time-interpolated, such as cloud fraction. |br|
     |br|

   * :file:`%y4-%m2-%h2T%h2:%n2:00` (or other combination of time
     tokens) : Update variable data when time tokens
     change. Interpreting this entry gets a little tricky. The data
     will be updated when the time tokens change, not the hard-coded
     times. For example, a template in the form
     :file:`%y4-%m2-%d2T12:00:00` changes at the start of each day
     because that is when the evaluation of :file:`%y4-%m2-%d2`
     changes. While the variable will be updated at the start of
     a new day (e.g. at time 2019-01-02 00:00:00), the time used
     for reading and interpolation is hour 12 of that day. You
     can similar hard-code year, month, day, or hour if you
     always want to use a constant value for that field. |br|
     |br|

   * :file:`F%y4-%m2-%h2T%h2:%n2:00` (or other combination of time
     tokens) : Like the previous option except that there is no time
     interpolation.

.. option:: Offset Factor

   Value the data will be shifted by upon read. Use :file:`none` for
   no shifting.

.. option:: Scale Factor

   Value the data will be scaled by upon read. This is useful if you
   want to convert units upon read, such as from :file:`Pa` to
   :file:`hPa`. Use :file:`none` for no scaling.

.. option:: External File Variable

   Name of the variable to read in the netCDF data file.

.. option:: External File Template

   Path to the netCDF data file, including time tokens as needed
   (:file:`%y4` for year, :file:`%m2` for month, :file:`%d2` for
   day,:file:`%h2` for hour, :file:`%n2` for minutes). If there are no
   time tokens in the template name then ExtData will assume that all
   the data is in one file. If you wish to ignore an entry in
   :file:`ExtData.rc` (i.e. not read the data at all since you will
   not use it) then put :file:`/dev/null`. This will save processing
   time.

.. option:: Reference Time and Period

   **OPTIONAL**. Period of data with reference time. This optional
   entry is useful if you have data frequency that is offset from
   midnight. For example, 3-hourly data available for times 1:30,
   4:30, 7:30, etc. The reference time could be specified as
   :file:`2000-01-01T01:30:00P03:00`. The first part (before
   :file:`P`) is the reference date (must be on or before your
   simulation start), and the second part (after :file:`P`) is the
   period of data availability (in this case 3 hours). This can be
   used in combination with the file template containing hours and
   minutes. It tells MAPL to only read the file at times that are
   regular 3 hr intervals from the reference date and time. Not
   including this would cause MAPL to read the file every minute if
   the file template contains the :file:`n2` time token.

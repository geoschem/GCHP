HISTORY.rc
==========

:file:`HISTORY.rc` is the file that configures GCHP's output. It has the following format

.. code-block:: none

   EXPID:  OutputDir/GCHP
   EXPDSC: GEOS-Chem_devel
   CoresPerNode: 30
   VERSION: 1

   <DEFINE GRID LABELS>

   <DEFINE ACTIVE COLLECTIONS>

   <DEFINE COLLECTIONS>


:EXPID:
   This is the file prefix for all collections. :code:`OutputDir/GCHP` means that collections
   will be to a direcotry named :file:`OutputDir/`, and the file names will start with `GCHP`.

:CoresPerNode:
   The number of cores per node for your GCHP simulation.

:EXPDSC:
   Leave this as it is.

:VERSION:
   Leave this as it is.

The format and description of :ref:`\<DEFINE GRID LABELS\> <defining-grid-labels>`, 
:ref:`\<DEFINE ACTIVE COLLECTIONS\> <defining-active-collections>`, and
and :ref:`\<DEFINE COLLECTIONS\> <defining-collections>` sections are given below.


.. _defining-grid-labels:

Defining Grid Labels
--------------------

You can specify custom grids for you output. For example, a regional 0.05°x0.05° grid covering
North America. This way your collections are regridded online. There are two advantages to doing
this

#. It eliminates the need to regrid your simulation data in a post-processing step.
#. It saves disk space if you are interested in regional output.

You can define as many grids as you want. A collection can define :code:`grid_label` to select
a custom grid. If a collection does not define :code:`grid_label` the simulation's grid is assumed.

Below is the format for the :code:`<DEFINE GRID LABELS>` section in :file:`HISTORY.rc`.

SPEC NAMES

:GRID_TYPE:
   The type of grid. Valid options are :code:`Cubed-Sphere` or :code:`LatLon`.

:IM_WORLD:
   The number of grid boxes in the i-dimension. For a :code:`LatLon` grid this is the number of longitude 
   grid-boxes. For a :code:`Cubed-Sphere` grid this is the cubed-sphere size (e.g., 48 for C48). 

:JM_WORLD:
   The number of grid boxes in the j-dimension. For a :code:`LatLon` grid this is the number of latitude 
   grid-boxes. For a :code:`Cubed-Sphere` grid this is six times the cubed-sphere size (e.g., 288 for C48).

:POLE:
   Required if the grid type is :code:`LatLon`. :code:`POLE` defines the latitude coordinates of the grid. For global
   lat-lon grids the valid options are :code:`PC` (pole-centered) or :code:`PE` (polar-edge). Here, "center" or "edge"
   refers to whether the grid has boxes that are centered on the poles, or whether the grid has boxes with
   edges at the poles. For regional grids :code:`POLE` should be set to :code:`XY` and the grid will have boxes with 
   edges at the regional boundaries.

:DATELINE:
   Required if the grid type is :code:`LatLon`. :code:`DATELINE` defines the longitude coordinates of the grid. For global
   lat-lon grids the valid options are :code:`DC` (dateline-centered), :code:`DE` (dateline-edge), :code:`GC` (grenwich-centered), 
   or :code:`GE` (grenwich-edge). If :code:`DC` or :code:`DE`, then the longitude coordinates will span (-180°, 180°). If 
   :code:`GC` or :code:`GE`, then the longitude coordinates will span (0°, 360°). Similar to :code:`POLE`, "center" or "edge"
   refer to whether the grid has boxes that are centered at -180° or 0°, or whether the grid has boxes with
   edges at -180° or 0°. For regional grids :code:`DATELINE` should be set to `XY` and the grid will have boxes with 
   edges at the regional boundaries.

:LON_RANGE:
   Required for regional :code:`LatLon` grids. :code:`LON_RANGE` defines the longitude bounds of the regional grid.

:LAT_RANGE:
   Required for regional :code:`LatLon` grids. :code:`LAT_RANGE` defines the latitude bounds of the regional grid.


.. _defining-active-collections:

Defining Active Collections
---------------------------

Collections are activated by defining them in the :code:`COLLECTIONS` list. For instructions on defining collections, see
:ref:`defining-collections`.


Below is the format for the :code:`<DEFINE ACTIVE COLLECTIONS>` section of :file:`HISTORY.rc`.

.. code-block:: none

   COLLECTIONS:   'MyCollection1',
                  'MyCollection2',
   ::

This example activates collections named "MyCollection1" and "MyCollection2".

.. _defining-collections:

.. code-block:: none

   MyCollection1.template:    '%y4%m2%d2_%h2%n2z.nc4',

   <DEFINE MORE COLLECTIONS ...>


**Output file configuration**

:template:
   This is the file name suffix for the collection. The path to the collection's files
   is obtained by concatenating :code:`EXPID` with the collection name and the value of
   :code:`template`.

:format:
   Defines the file format of the collection. Valid values are :code:`'CFIO'` for CF 
   compliant NetCDF (recommended), or :code:`'flat'` for GrADS style flat files.

:duration:
   Defines the frequency at which files are generated. The format is :code:`HHMMSS`. For example,
   :code:`1680000` means that a file is generated every 168 hours (7 days).

:monthly: *[optional]*
   Set to :code:`1` for monthly output. One file per month is generated. If :code:`mode` is 
   :code:`time-averaged`, the variables in the collection are 1-month time averages.

   :code:`duration` and :code:`frequency` are not required if :code:`monthly: 1`.    

:timeStampStart: *[optional]*
   Only used if :code:`mode` is :code:`'time-averaged'`. If :code:`.true.`
   the file is timestamped according to the start of the accumulation interval (which depends on
   :code:`frequency`, :code:`ref_date`, and :code:`ref_time`). If :code:`.false.` the file is
   timestamped according to the middle of the accumulation interval. If :code:`timeStampStart` is
   not set then the default value is false.

**Sampling configuration**

:mode:
   Defines the sampling method. Valid values are :code:`'time-averaged'` or :code:`'instantaneous'`.

:frequency:
   Defines the time frequency of collection's data. Said another way, this defines the time separation 
   (time step) of the time coordinate for the collection. The format is :code:`HHMMSS`. For example,
   :code:`010000` means that the collection's time coordinate will have a 1-hour time step. If 
   :code:`frequency` is less than :code:`duration` multiple time steps are written to each file.

:acc_interval: *[optional]*
   Only valid if :code:`mode` is :code:`'time-averaged'`. This specifies the length of the time 
   average. By default it is equal to :code:`frequency`.

:ref_date: *[optional]*
   The reference date from which the frequency is based. The format is :code:`YYYYMMDD`. For example,
   a frequency of :code:`1680000` (7 days) with a reference date of `20210101` means that the time coordinate
   will be weeks since 2021-01-01. The default value is the simulation's start date.

:ref_time: *[optional]*
   The reference time from which the frequency is based. The format is :code:`HHMMSS`. 
   The default value is :code:`000000`. See :code:`ref_date`.

:fields:
   Defines the list of fields that this collection should use. The format (per-field) is 
   :code:`'FieldName', 'GridCompName',`. For example, :code:`'SpeciesConc_O3', 'GCHPchem',` specifies
   that this collection should include the `SpeciesConc_O3` field from the `GCHPchem` gridded component.

   Fields from multiple gridded components can be included in the same collection. However, a collection
   must not mix fields that are defined at the center of vertical levels and the edges of vertical levels 
   (e.g., `Met_PMID` and `Met_PEDGE` cannot be included in the same collection).

   Variables can be renamed in the output by adding :code:`'your_custom_name',` at the end. For example,
   :code:`'SpeciesConc_O3', 'GCHPchem', 'ozone_concentration',` would rename the SpeciesConc_O3 field to
   "ozone_concentration" in the output file.

**Output grid configuration**

:grid_label: *[optional]*
   Defines the grid that this collection should be output on. The lable must match on of the grid labels defined
   in :ref:`\<DEFINE GRID LABELS\> <defining-grid-labels>`. If :code:`grid_label` isn't set then the collection
   uses the simulation's horizontal grid.

:conservative: *[optional]*
   Defines whether or not regridding to the output grid should use ESMF's first-order conservative method. Valid 
   values are :code:`0` or :code:`1`. It is recommended you set this to :code:`1` if you are using :code:`grid_label`.
   The default value is :code:`0`.

:levels: *[optional]*
   Defines the model levels that this collection should use (i.e., a subset of the simulation levels).
   The format is a space-separated list of values. The lowest layer is 1 and the highest layer is 72. 
   For example, :code:`1 2 5` would select the first, second, and fifth level of the simulation.

:track_file: *[optional]*
   Defines the path to a 1D track file along which the collection is sampled. See :ref:`output-along-a-track` for
   more info.

:recycle_track: *[optional]*
   Only valid if a :code:`track_file` is defined. Specifies that the track file should be reused every day. If
   :code:`.true.` the dates in the track file are automatically forced to the simulation's current date. The
   default value is false.

**Other configuration**

:end_date: *[optional]*
   A date at which the collection is deactivated (turned off). By default there is no end date.

:end_time: *[optional]*
   Time at which the collection is deactivated (turned off) on the :code:`end_date`.


Example :file:`HISTORY.rc` configuration
----------------------------------------

Below is an example :file:`HISTORY.rc` that configures two output collection

1. 30-min instantaneous concentrations of O3, NO, NO2, and some meteorological parameters
   for the lowest 10 model levels on a 0.1°x0.1° covering the US. Each file contains one
   day of data. 
2. 24-hour time averages of O3, NO, and NO2 concentrations, NO emissions, and some meteorological 
   parameters. The horizontal grid is the simulation's grid. All vertical levels are use. Each
   file contains one week worth of data, and files are generated relative to 2017-01-01.

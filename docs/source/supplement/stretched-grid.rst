Stretched-Grid Simulation
#########################

.. note::

   Stretched-grid simulations are described in
   :cite:`Bindle_et_al._2021`. This paper also discusses related tpics
   of consideration and offers guidance for choosing appropriate
   stretching parameters.

========
Overview
========

A stretched-grid is a cubed-sphere grid that is "stretched" to enhance
its resolution in a region.  To set up a stretched-grid simulation you
need to do the following:

#. Choose stretching parameters, including stretch factor and target
   latitude and longitude.
#. Create a stretched grid restart file for your simulation using your
   chosen stretch parameters.
#. Configure the GCHP run directory to specify stretched grid
   parameters in :file:`setCommonRunSettings.sh` and use your
   stretched grid restart file.


Choose stretching parameters
----------------------------

The :term:`target face` is the face of a stretched-grid that shrinks
so that the grid resolution is finer. The target face is centered on a
target point, and the degree of stretching is controlled by a
parameter called the stretch-factor. Relative to a normal
cubed-sphere, the resolution of the target face is refined by
approximately the stretch-factor. For example, a C60 stretched-grid
with a stretch-factor of 3.0 has approximately C180 (~50 km)
resolution in the target face. The enhancement-factor is approximate
because (1) the stretching gradually changes with distance from the
target point, and (2) gnominic cubed-sphere grids are quasi-uniform
with grid-boxes at face edges being ~1.5x shorter than at face
centers.

You can choose a stretch-factor and target point using the interactive
figure below. You can reposition the target face by changing the
target longitude and target latitude. The domain of refinement can be
increased or decreased by changing the stretch-factor. Choose
parameters so that the target face roughly covers the refion that you
want to refine.

   The interactive figure above can be a bit fiddly. Refresh the page
   if the view gets messed up.  If the figure above is not showing up
   properly, please `open an issue
   <https://gchp.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/SUPPORT.html>`_.

Next you need to choose a cubed-sphere size. The cubed-sphere size
must be an even integer (e.g., C90, C92, C94, etc.). Remember that the
resolution of the target face is enhanced by approximately the
stretch-factor.


.. _sg_restart_file_regridding:

Create a restart file
---------------------

A simulation restart file must have the same grid as the
simulation. For example, a C180 simulation requires a restart file
with a C180 grid. Likewise, a stretched-grid simulation needs a
restart file with the same stretched-grid (i.e., an identical
cubed-sphere size, stretch-factor, target longitude, and target
latitude). It also requires that the file contain global attributes
specifying the stretch parameters as floating point. These attributes
should be named :literal:`TARGET_LAT`, :literal:`TARGET_LON`, and
:literal:`STRETCH_FACTOR`.

You can regrid an existing restart file to a stretched-grid using the
GEOS-Chem python package GCPy. See the `Regridding
<https://gcpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/Regridding.html>`_ section of
the GCPy documentation for instructions.  Inspect your restart file
to make sure the global attributes for stretch parameters are as you
expect them to be.

.. note::

    A stretched grid restart file is available for download if you
    would like to quickly get set up to run a stretched grid
    simulation. See the `GEOSCHEM_RESTARTS/GC_14.0.0
    <http://geoschemdata.wustl.edu/ExtData/GEOSCHEM_RESTARTS/GC_14.0.0/>`_
    directory in the GEOS-Chem data repository.

Configure run directory
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once you have created a restart file for your simulation, you can move on to updating your
simulation's configuration files.
Modify the section of :file:`setCommonRunSettings.sh` that controls
the simulation grid. Turn :envvar:`STRETCH_GRID` to :literal:`ON` and
update :envvar:`CS_RES`, :envvar:`STRETCH_FACTOR`,
:envvar:`TARGET_LAT`, and :envvar:`TARGET_LON` for your specific
grid. The values must exactly match those of the global attrbiutes in your
restart file.

.. code-block:: bash

   #------------------------------------------------
   #   GRID RESOLUTION
   #------------------------------------------------
   # Integer representing number of grid cells per cubed-sphere face side
   CS_RES=24

   #------------------------------------------------
   #   STRETCHED GRID
   #------------------------------------------------
   # Turn stretched grid ON/OFF. Follow these rules if ON:
   #    (1) Minimum STRETCH_FACTOR value is 1.0001
   #    (2) TARGET_LAT and TARGET_LON are floats containing decimal
   #    (3) STRETCH_FACTOR, TARGET_LAT, and TARGET_LON are global
   #        attributes in your restart file with exactly the same
   #        values as floating point
   STRETCH_GRID=OFF
   STRETCH_FACTOR=3.0
   TARGET_LAT=40.0
   TARGET_LON=-95.0

Execute :program:`./setCommonRunSettings.sh` to update your run
directory's configuration files.

.. code-block:: console

   $ ./setCommonRunSettings.sh

You will also need to configure the run directory to use the stretched
grid restart file.

#. Update :file:`cap_restart` to match the date of your restart
   file. This will also be the start date of the run.

#. Copy or symbolically link to your restart file in the
   :literal:`Restarts` subdirectory with the proper filename
   format. The format includes global resolution but not stretched
   grid resolution. To avoid confusion about what grid the file
   contains you can symbolically link to a file with stretched grid
   parameters in its filename.

#. Run :literal:`setRestartLink.sh` to set symbolic link
   :file:`gchp_restart.nc4` to point to your restart file based on
   start date in :file:`cap_restart` and global grid resolution in
   :file:`setCommonRunSettings.sh`. This is also included as pre-run
   step in all example run scripts provided in :file:`runScriptSamples`.

Output Files
^^^^^^^^^^^^

GCHP diagnostics files that are output on a stretched grid will contain global
attributes specifying the stretch parameters. Output checkpoint files
will also contain these parameters. Beware the output filenames, including
restart filenames, will not contain stretch parameter information. When in doubt,
always check the global attributes of the file.

===============================
Tutorial: Eastern United States
===============================

This tutorial walks you through setting up and running a stretched-grid simulation for ozone in the eastern United States.
The grid parameters for this tutorial are:

=====================     ================
Parameter                 Value
=====================     ================
Stretch-factor            3.6
Cubed-sphere size         C60
Target latitude           37° N
Target longitude          275° E
=====================     ================

These parameters are chosen so that the target face covers the eastern United States.
Some back-of-the-envelope resolution calculations are:

.. math::

   \mathrm{average\ resolution\ of\ target\ face = R_{tf} \approx
   \frac{10000\ km}{N \times S} = 46\ km}

.. math::

   \mathrm{coarsest\ resolution\ in\ target\ face\ (at\ the\ center)
   \approx R_{tf} \times 1.2 = 56\ km }

.. math::

   \mathrm{finest\ resolution\ in\ target\ face\ (at\ the\ edges)
   \approx R_{tf} \div 1.2 = 39\ km }

.. math::

   \mathrm{coarsest\ resolution\ globally\ (at\ target\ antipode)
   \approx R_{tf} \times S^2 \times 1.2 = 720\ km }


where :math:`\mathrm{N}` is the cubed-sphere size and
:math:`\mathrm{S}` is the stretch-factor. The actual values of these,
calculated from the grid-box areas, are 46 km, 51 km, 42 km, and
664 km respectively.

.. note::

    This tutorial uses a relatively large stretch-factor. A smaller
    stretch-factor, such as 2.0 rather than 3.6, would have a broader
    refinement and smaller range resolutions.

Requirements
------------

Before continuing with the tutorial check that you have all pre-requisites:

* You are able to run global GCHP simulations using MERRA2 data for July 2019
* You have the latest version of GEOS-Chem python package GCPy
* You have python package cartopy with version >= 0.19

Create run directory
--------------------

Create a standard full chemistry run directory that uses MERRA2 meteorology.
The rest of the tutorial assume that your current working directory is
your run directory.


Create restart file
-------------------

You will need to create a restart file with a horizontal resolution
that matches your chosen stretched-grid resolution.  Unlike other
input data, GCHP ingests the restart file with no online
regridding. Using a restart file with a horizontal grid that does not
match the run grid will result in a run-time error.  To create a
restart file for a stretched-grid simulation you can regrid a restart
file with a uniform grid using GCPy. Follow instructions on how to
create a GCHP stretched grid restart file in the `GCPy documentation
<https://gcpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/Regridding.html>`_. For this
tutorial regrid the c48 fullchem restart file for July 1, 2019 that
comes with a GCHP fullchem run directory
(:file:`GEOSChem.Restart.20190701_0000z.c48.nc4`). Grid resolution is
60, stretch factor is 3.6, target longitude is -95, and target
latitude is 37. Name the output file
:file:`initial_GEOSChem_rst.EasternUS_SG_fullchem.c60.s3.6_37N_275E.nc`.

Configure run directory
-----------------------

Make the following modifications to :file:`setCommonRunSettings.sh`:

* Change the simulation's duration to 7 days
* Turn on auto-update of diagnostics
* Set diagnostic frequency to 24 hours (daily)
* Set diagnostic duration to 24 hours (daily)
* Update the compute resources as you like. This simulation's computational
  demands are about 50% more than a C48 or 2°x2.5° simulation.
* Change global grid resolution to 60
* Change :literal:`STRETCH_GRID` to :literal:`ON`
* Change :literal:`STRETCH_FACTOR` to :literal:`3.6`
* Change :literal:`TARGET_LAT` to :literal:`37.0`
* Change :literal:`TARGET_LON` to :literal:`-95.0`

.. note::
    In our tests this simulation took approximately 7 hours to run
    using 30 cores on 1 node. For comparison, it took 2 hours to run
    using 180 cores across 6 notes. You may choose your compute
    resources based on how long you are willing to wait for your run
    to end.

Next, execute :file:`setCommonRunSettings.sh` to apply the updates to
the various configuration files:

.. code-block:: console

   $ ./setCommonRunSettings.sh

Before running GCHP you also need to configure the model to use your
stretched-grid restart file. Move or copy your restart file to the
:file:`Restarts` subdirectory. Then change the symbolic link
:file:`GEOSChem.Restart.20190701_0000z.c48.nc4` to point to your
stretched-grid restart file while keeping the name of the
link the same.

.. code-block:: console

   $ ln -nsf initial_GEOSChem_rst.EasternUS_SG_fullchem.c60.s3.6_37N_275E.nc GEOSChem.Restart.20190701_0000z.c48.nc4

You could also rename your restart file to this format but this would
remove valuable information about the content of the file from the
filename. Symbolically linking is a better way to preserve the
information to avoid errors. You can check that you did this correctly
by running :file:`setRestartLink.sh` in the run directory.

Run GCHP
--------

To run GCHP you can use the example run script for running
interactively located at :file:`runScriptSamples/gchp.local.run` as
long as you have enough resources available locally, e.g. 30 cores on
1 node. Copy it to the main level of your run directory and then
execute it. If you want to use more resources you can submit as a
batch job to your scheduler.

.. code-block:: console

   $ ./gchp.local.run

Log output of the run will be sent to log file
:file:`gchp.20190701_0000z.log`. Check that your run was successful by
inspecting the log and looking for output in the
:file:`OutputDir` subdirectory.

.. _sg_plotting_example:

Plot the output
---------------

Plotting stretched grid is simple using Python. Below is an example
plotting ozone at model level 22. All libraries are available if using
a python environment compatible with GCPy.

.. code-block:: python

    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import cartopy.crs as ccrs
    import xarray as xr

    # Load 24-hr average concentrations for 2019-07-01
    ds = xr.open_dataset('GCHP.DefautlCollection.20190701_0000z.nc4')

    # Get Ozone at level 22
    ozone_data = ds['SpeciesConcVV_O3'].isel(time=0, lev=22).squeeze()

    # Setup axes
    ax = plt.axes(projection=ccrs.EqualEarth())
    ax.set_global()
    ax.coastlines()

    # Plot data on each face
    for face_idx in range(6):
        x = ds.corner_lons.isel(nf=face_idx)
        y = ds.corner_lats.isel(nf=face_idx)
        v = ozone_data.isel(nf=face_idx)
        pcm = plt.pcolormesh(
            x, y, v,
            transform=ccrs.PlateCarree(),
            vmin=20e-9, vmax=100e-9
        )

    plt.colorbar(pcm, orientation='horizontal')
    plt.show()

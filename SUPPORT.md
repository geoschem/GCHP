# Support Guidelines

GEOS-Chem support is maintained by the [GEOS-Chem Support Team (GCST)](http://wiki.geos-chem.org/GEOS-Chem_Support_Team). The GCST members are based at Harvard University and Washington University in St. Louis.

We track bugs, user questions, and feature requests through [GitHub issues](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFBhdotYVf8). Please help out as you can in response to issues and user questions.

## How to report a bug
We use GitHub to track issues. To report a bug, [open a new issue](https://github.com/geoschem/GCHP/issues/new/choose). Please include all the information that might be relevant, including simulation log files and instructions for replicating the bug.

## Where can I ask for help?
We use GitHub issues to support user questions. To ask a question, [open a new issue](https://github.com/geoschem/GCHP/issues/new/choose) and select the question template. 

## What type of support can I expect?

We will be happy to assist you in resolving bugs and technical issues that arise when compiling or running GEOS-Chem.  User support and outreach is an important part of our mission to support the [International GEOS-Chem User Community](https://geoschem.github.io/geos-chem-people-projects-map/).

Even though we can assist in several ways, we cannot possibly do everything.  We rely on GEOS-Chem users being resourceful and willing to try to resolve problems on their own to the greatest extent possible.

If you have a science question rather than a technical question, you should contact the relevant [GEOS-Chem Working Group(s)](https://geos-chem.seas.harvard.edu/geos-working-groups) directly. But if you do not know whom to ask, you may [open a new issue](https://github.com/geoschem/GCHP/issues/new/choose). and we will be happy to direct your question to the appropriate person(s).
